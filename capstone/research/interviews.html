        <h2>Target Audience Interviews</h2>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>My taget audience is college students at UC Davis. Through my target audience interviews, I learned that most college students are not very familiar with the history of Davis. Students seem to be very focused on Davis as a school, not the entirety of Davis and the history that came before the school. I also learned that most student’s knowledge of Davis is related to current events found on the news or through other people.</p>
        <p>I also learned that students are actually very open to learning more about the history of Davis. Most students have visited the Centennial Seal as they’ve been downtown, but they may not have noticed it or payed it much attention. Despite this, students are open to learning more about the history of Davis through the Centennial Seal.</p>
        <p>I also learned students preferred way of learning new information is through electronic resources. This includes new articles and informational websites. I also learned students feel their memory retention is better when they learn online through interactive activities. Most students feel that a learning-game is one of the best ways to learn more information.</p>
