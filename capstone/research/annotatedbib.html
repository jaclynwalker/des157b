        <h3>Interactive Websites: Improve Your Site’s Engagement</h3>
        <p>Building an interactive website can help users enjoy your website more as you deliver your content. It is important to think strategically in order to most effectively deliver content with interactive features. It is important to engage the user's senses through visuals that can be either animated, videos, or regular images. It is also important to include interactive hover features so the user is guided as to where they can click. Animating the page as the user scrolls is another way to encourage the user to further explore a webpage. It is also important to capture your unique artistic style within your website. Building an interactive website is also a great way to deliver educational information, since it allows the user to engage deeper with the content and creates a memorable experience.</p>
