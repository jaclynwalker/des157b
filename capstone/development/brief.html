        <h2>Project Brief</h2>

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>I want to create a puzzle version of the Davis Centennial Seal. As the user pieces together the puzzle, they will be able to learn facts about each piece of the seal.</p>

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p>I want to benefit users through an interactive experience that allows them to get a closer look at each piece of the seal by putting it together as a puzzle.</p>

        <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
        <p>I want my design to be simple and easy for users of any age to use. The text will be large and readable. The majority of the page will be dedicated to the puzzle pieces and puzzle form comprised of the visual of the seal.</p>

        <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
        <p>I want to use drag-and-drop and snap interaction strategies as interactive features for users. I also want to include text that appears and disappears as the user interacts with different pieces of the puzzle.</p>

        <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
        <p>I want my interactive seal puzzle to give people who may not know much about the seal a chance to learn more about the seal and what it represents. I want to use a puzzle because it is a simple interactive game that will give each user a chance to look at and interact with each individual piece of the seal as they play the game.</p>

        <h3>Target Users</h3>
        <p>My target user base is college-age students who are not familiar with Davisâ€™s history. I also want my project to be a good experience for people of other ages, especially younger children.</p>
