        <p>I shared my storyboard with a classmate to compare the ideas we came up with. Sharing my storyboard helped me think more about how exactly my target audience will find my website. Since I want to target students who may have seen the Davis Centennial Seal downtown and want to learn more, I want to figure out a way my page can be shared with them. If I were to make a chnage to my storyboard, I would add a possible way for students to find my site. For example, they may find the link to my project through another website or through a flyer.</p>
