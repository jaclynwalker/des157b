                <p>My project is a puzzle game of the Davis Centennial Seal. Its goal is to encourage users to take a closer look at the seal as they complete the puzzle. My target audience is college students, but I also want my puzzle to cater to any age group. </p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>During my comparitive research, I looked at examples of other eductaional sites. I found that the best designed sites have simple yet engaing UI design. I also found that making information interactive is one of the most effective ways to get users to engage and remember what they learned.</p>
                <p>Before my comparative research, I was somehwat unsure on my project idea. After doing research, my idea to create a puzzle was solidified because I realized it was an effective way to engage users with the material of the page.</p>

                <p>In my digital comp, I decided to use a blue gradient background. The layout is centered around the puzzle, with buttons at the bottom.</p>

                <h3>Version 1</h3>
                <p>In my version 1 design, I kept the blue gradient background. I also kept the layout but changed the button design and the ouzzle containers slightly.</p>

                <h3>Version 2</h3>
                <p>In my version 2 design, I changed the photo of the puzzle and made the puzzle 35 pieces instead of 16.</p>

                <h3>Version 3</h3>
                <p>In my version 3 design, I changed the style and layout of the buttons according to the code I had written.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>After user testing, I was able to further refine my project. I added animations that catch the user attention to better alert them when puzzle pieces are correctly and incorrectly placed. I also added a finishing screen the user can view when they have finished the game.</p>
                <p>If I continued to further develop this project, I would add more features that describe the history of the seal. For example, I would allow the user to hover over parts of the ouzzle to learn about them. I would also change the UI design to make the page more visually appealing, since it is very plain right now and I feel it can be improved.</p>

                <p>This project helped me learn a lot about JavaScript. Before this project, I felt unsure of my ability to use libraries and to create an interactive webpage. Writing the code for this puzzle challenged me to experiement more with code, and I feel like I have greatly improved my coding abilities in the process.</p>
